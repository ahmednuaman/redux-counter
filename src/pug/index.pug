        p. 
          This project is just a collection of examples that use Redux in the back and different template frameworks 
          in the front

            h2 What, why?
            p. 
              I like #[a(href='https://github.com/reactjs/redux') Redux]. It's a very elegant solution to a common 
              problem faced by javascript developers relating to state. And by state I mean the little bit of code 
              that's in that little container. 
            p.
              Now one can say "well I can just create factories/services/blahs..." and that's totally cool too, but I 
              believe consistency is the key to harmonious projects and rolling your own stuff all the time may not be 
              everyone's bag.

            h2 So what is the problem?
            p.
              I love javascript, but javascript has a problem, a problem with mutation of objects and arrays, 
              for example:

            pre.
                const someObj = { a: 1, b: 2 }
                const func = (obj) => obj.a = 3
                
                func(someObj)
                console.log(someObj) 

            p.
              This will return #[code Object {a: 3, b: 2}], even though #[code someObj] is a constant. 
              I love javascript. So imagine having that in lots of places with lots and lots of data. 
              All the fun, they said.

              each example in examples
                a(href=example.toLowerCase() + '.html').list-group-item
